# Linear classifier - logistic regressor

This project creates a simple logistic regressor for classifying images from the BreastMNIST dataset as 0 (cancer) or 1 (healthy). It was many modules from the SciKit Learn library. The files in this project are used as follow:

- logreg_cv: k-fold cross validation for hyperparameter tuning. 
- logreg_test: Compares the model built with the optimal value of the regularization parameter and class weights, and the test samples.

To visualize the final results, just run logreg_test.py.
